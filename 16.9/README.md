# scidb-eo
Docker Images for Earth Observation Analytics with SciDB

---


## Prerequisites
- [Docker Engine](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-engine) (>1.10.0) 
- Around 15 GBs free disk space 
- Internet connection to download software and dependencies


## Getting started

_**Note**: Depending on your Docker configuration, the following commands must be executed with sudo rights._

### 1. Build the Docker image (1-2 hours)

The provided Docker image is based on a minimally sized Ubuntu OS. Among others, it includes the compilation and installation of [SciDB](http://www.paradigm4.com/), [GDAL](http://gdal.org/), SciDB extensions ([scidb4geo](https://github.com/appelmar/scidb4geo),  [scidb4gdal](https://github.com/appelmar/scidb4gdal)) and the installation of all dependencies. The image will take around 15 GBs of disk space. It can be created by executing:

```
git clone https://github.com/appelmar/scidb-eo && cd scidb-eo/16.9
docker build --tag="scidb-eo:16.9" . # don't miss the dot
``` 

_Note that by default, this includes a rather careful SciDB configuration with relatively little demand for main memory. You may modify `conf/scidb_docker.ini` if you have a powerful machine._


### 2. Start a container 

The following command starts a cointainer in detached mode, i.e. it will run as a service until it is explicitly stopped with `docker stop scidbeo-scalbf`.

_Note that the following command limits the number of CPU cores and main memory available to the container. Feel free to use different settings for `--cpuset-cpu` and `-m`._


```
sudo docker run -d --name="scidb-eo-1609" --cpuset-cpus="0,1" -m "4G" -h "scidb-eo-1609" -p 33330:22 -p 33331:8083 -p 33332:8787 scidb-eo:16.9 
```

The container is now accessible to the host system via SSH (port 33330), Shim (port 33331), and Rstudio Server (port 33332).


### 3. Clean up
To clean up your system, you can remove containers and the image with

1. `sudo docker rm -f scidb-eo-1609`  and 
2. `sudo docker rmi scidb-eo:16.09`.
